# Mercenary

Mercenary is the original and temporary title given to a game I began developing in order to explore SpriteKit in XCode using Swift. The Game eventually became Space Trucker for reasons obscure and is currently in a demo state demonstrating the basic mechanics of the game over the course of one level which repeats itself. 

Sound effects are temporary place holders found online. 
Soundtrack is my own original work created with FL Studio.
The graphics are also original work using Sketch 3. 


Looking back several months later, I can see how cumbersome and complex this code is. In the future I will either refactor this code or write a new app from scratch utilizing the design principles and better understanding of swift I have come to have since.
